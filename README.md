> *"Why just read about me when you can chat with me? I'm like ChatGPT, but with more coconut oil and Malayalam charm!"* 🥥

Meet Ajay Prasad P K's AI-powered voice bot - where artificial intelligence meets authentic Kerala hospitality! This isn't just another chatbot; it's your personal window into the life of an AI professional who went from the backwaters of Calicut to the tech parks of Trivandrum.
